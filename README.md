Dear [Recipient’s Name],

I am writing to express my interest in an internship opportunity at **[Company/Organization Name]**. I am a 17-year-old student currently studying **Business, Innovation, and Data Analytics (BIDA)** at **Botswana Accountancy College**, and I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting while gaining practical experience.

I am particularly interested in applying these skills in a real-world environment, learning from experienced professionals, and contributing meaningfully to your organization’s projects and goals.

I am a highly motivated and quick learner, capable of adapting to new environments and challenges. I am confident that an internship at your organization will provide me with the opportunity to enhance my professional skills, gain practical experience, and make a valuable contribution to your team.

I have attached my CV for your review. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your organization as an intern and would welcome any chance to interview at your convenience.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to **[Company/Organization Name]** and learning from your team.

If you want, I can also **write a shorter, punchier version** that emphasizes your enthusiasm and is more likely to stand out to companies offering internships. Do you want me to do that?
